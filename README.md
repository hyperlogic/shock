AC script woes
-------------------
Avatar positions are not accessible to ac scripts.
currentapi.js doesn't work for ac-scripts.
EntityViewer is not documented and necessary for Entities.findEntities() to to function.
entity scripts have funky syntax that dont pass jshint.
Entity script onEnter doesnt trigger when someone spawns inside of the entity.
Entity scripts sometimes do not run after a server-console "restart".

Entity script woes
---------------------
Not easy to determine what event methods are called.  The docs should somehow catergorize them.
